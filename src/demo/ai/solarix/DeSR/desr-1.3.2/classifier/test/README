Sample usage of the Maximum Entropy Classifier.

1. Check that in the Makefile you have the proper definitions of
   the directories for libME.a

	MEDIR = ../model

   On Windows you need also strtok_r which is part of IXE, so you may
   also need:

	IXEDIR = ../../ixe

2. Compile with:

	make

3. Train the model, for instance on the file gameLocation.dat

	train gameLocation gameLocation.dat

   This produces a model in gameLocation.mem.

4. Test the model:

	predict gameLocation.mem
