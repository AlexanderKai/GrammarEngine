@page introduction Introduction

DeSR is a dependency parser for natural language sentences. 

Among its notable features: 

<UL>
<li><em>accuracy</em>: close to state of the art accuracy 
<li><em>efficiency</em>: it can parse up to 200 sentence/sec 
<li><em>multilingual</em>: it can be trained from an annotated corpus on multiple languages 
<li><em>customizable</em>: features used in training can be customized. 


@section technique Technique

DeSR is a shift-reduce dependency parser, which uses a variant of the approach
of (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003).

Dependency structures are built scanning the input from left to right and
deciding at each step whether to perform a shift or to create a dependency
between two adjacent tokens.

DeSR uses though a different set of rules and includes additional rules to
handle non-projective dependencies that allow parsing to be performed
deterministically in a single pass. The algorithm also produces fully labeled
dependency trees.

A classifier is used for learning and predicting the proper parsing
action. The parser can be configured, selecting among several learning
algorithms (Averaged Perceptron, Maximum Entropy, memory-based learning using
TiMBL, support vector machines using libSVM), providing user-defined feature
models, and selecting input-output formats (including the CoNLL shared task
format).

@section training Training

Suppose you have both the parser and the configuration file in the same
directory, you call: 

<pre class='fragment'>
   desr -t -m modelFile trainFile
</pre>

to produce a model from a training corpus in CoNLL format. 

Be careful using option SecondOrder, since it may considerably increase the
model size. 

@section parsing Parsing

To parse sentences in CoNLL format, use: 

<pre class='fragment'>
   desr -m modelFile parseFile > parsedFile
</pre>

If you plan to use the downloaded model file, first gunzip it. 

For a full list of options, type: 

<pre class='fragment'>
   desr -h
</pre>

@section classifiers Classifiers

Several classifiers are available, including:
Maximum Entropy (-aME), Perceptron (-aAP), MBL (-aMBL) or SVM (-aSVM). The
algorithm can also be specified in the configuration file desr.conf as well as
the features to be used.

<LI> Memory Based Learning (requires optional library)
<LI> SnOW (requires optional library)
